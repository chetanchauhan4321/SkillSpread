### Description of the problem and solution.###
 Problem- I got requirements of this project from a person who wants to have a website of his own where he can spread his skill to others and can sell his courses and the books written by him. 
 Solution- I have made this website where admin can add as many courses and books which are written by him. He can upload the courses and books and can delete them also. I have used the database to Solve the problem
           with the help of database everything related to uploading and deletiing is done in this website.
		  
### Whether the solution focuses on back-end, front-end or if it's full stack.###
 My Solution focuses on full stack.
 
### Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural.###
 The Technologies which I have used are - HTML5, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, JavaScript, PHP,AngularJS MySQL, XAMPP SERVER, Web-hosting.
 The reasonbehind choosing
 HTML5     - It is a basic building block of any website. User Interface is made by using HTML5;
 CSS       - To give interface some style I have Used the CSS.
 BOOTSTRAP - To make website RESPONSIVE and to make is beautiful.
 PHP       - I have used the PHP which is server side scripting language with the help of PHP I have connected the database to the website.
 MySQL     - To store the data which is needed in the website.
 JavaScript- For some basic functionality.
 AngularJS - If user want to upload the picture of any course and the book. He can preview this dynamically.
 Hosting-  - To upload all the file on the server and make available to use for all.
